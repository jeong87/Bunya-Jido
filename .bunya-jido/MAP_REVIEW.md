# Bunya-Jido Map Review Log

This file records reviewed map-maintenance decisions when policy-covered
repository changes do not require rewriting the semantic structure itself.
An entry records review work; it does not prove architectural completeness.

## 2026-05-28 - PR 11.1 Portability And Stale-Map Gate

- Change: Added `check-stale`, cross-platform CI coverage, and OS-specific
  onboarding guidance.
- Decision: Added `stale_map_policy` to the agent map. Existing semantic
  nodes, workflows, and task routes remain adequate for this maintenance gate.
- Validation: `validate-blueprint`, `validate-agent-map`, strict `diagnose`,
  `check-stale --require-reviewed`, and the unit test suite passed.
